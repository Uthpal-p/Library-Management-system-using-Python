# A-simple-Library-Management-system-using-Python
## Libraries used: Pandas and Datetime.
### This program uses a CSV file as the database to handle the list of books and their borrower/due date/availability details. The Terminal is used to operate the program and doesn't use a GUI. 

This is a simple library management system that an admin can operate to  
 -> view the list of books and their availability  
 -> lend books  
 -> return books    
 -> view the list of books borrowed by a certain student (while returning a book)  
 -> automatically calculate the FINE to be paid for late return of book beyond the due date.  
 
 -> errors such as lending a book which isn't available, trying to return a book which isn't borrowed by that student are also handled.  
 -> new books can be added to the database by directly editing the CSV file.
 
 ## Instructions to run the program:
 Put both the main_lms.py and Book_list.csv file in a single folder and run the python file using command "python main_lms.py".
